# viewDOS
Simple shellscript to quickly generate an ordered list of all IPs connected to multiple servers in X ports, showing the amount of connections detailed with geolocation. 

It is intended to quickly get a report of suspicious IP addresses of several clusters under different types of DOS attacks. It just connects by SSH to different servers and uses netstat to obtain the desired information.

**Dependency** (optional but recommended).

Command geoiplookup / [geoip-bin] (http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/ "MaxMindâ€™s GeoIP2 databases.")

**viewDOS configuration options**.

```sh
# Temporary file name.
file_tmp="/tmp/viewDOS.$(date +%Y_%m_%d-%H_%M_%S).txt" 

# Filter IPs using any of the defined tcp/udp ports.
ports=":80 \|:443"                     

# IPs that will be ignored and will not be counted (whitelist).
ignoreip="127.0.0.1\|localhost"

# Red mark on hosts that have more than X connections.
red=5                       

# Red mark on hosts that have more than X tcp connections to a particular state.
red_tcp_state=2		    

# Show only IPs that have more than X connections.
min_conn=0		    

# Show only IPs that have more than X tcp connections.
min_state_conn=0	    

# Netstat command and options that will run on the destination hosts to list connections (TCP / UDP / PID).
netstat_cmd="netstat -ptun" 

# Command geolocation + options, necessary to display geopositioned data.
geoip_cmd="geoiplookup"     

# state TCP connections (FIN_WAIT2, SYN_RECV, UNKNOW, etc.)
tcp_state="SYN_RECV"
# Multiple TCP states example: tcp_state="SYN_RECV\|TIME_WAIT\|CLOSE_WAIT".
# Multiple TCP states with separate output, check line 132.
```
